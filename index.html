        "Hey Dorothea Do you ever stop and think about me?
        <br />
        When we were younger
        <br />
        Down in the park Honey, making a lark of the misery
        <br />
        You got shiny friends since you left town
        <br />
        A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
        <br />
        And I got nothing but well wishes for ya
        <br />
        Ooh This place is the same as it ever was
        <br />
        Ooh But you don't like it that way
        <br />
        It's never too late To come back to my side
        <br />
        The stars in your eyes Shined brighter in Tupelo
        <br />
        And if you're ever tired of being known For who you know You know,
        you'll always know me
        <br />
        Dorothea (ah-ah) Dorothea
        <br />
        (ah-ah) Ooh, you're a queen Selling dreams Selling make up and magazines
        Ooh, from you I'd buy anything
        <br />
        Hey Dorothea Do you ever stop and think about me?
        <br />
        When it was calmer Skipping the prom Just to piss off your mom And her
        pageant schemes
        <br />
        And damn, Dorothea They all wanna be ya But are you still the same soul
        I met under the bleachers?
        <br />
        Well Ooh
        <br />
        I guess I'll never know Ooh
        <br />And you'll go on with the show
        <br />
        But it's never too late To come back to my side
        <br />
        The stars in your eyes Shined brighter in Tupelo
        <br />
        And if you're ever tired of being known For who you know You know,
        you'll always know me Dorothea
        <br />
